# Responsible Disclosure

If we detect or are informed of a data or flag leak, we will immediately:

1. Post a disclosure on the course forum with a brief timeline and scope.  
2. Rotate all three flags (repo root, /app/flag, Mr Important.pdf).  
3. Mitigate the root cause and add a regression test if applicable.  
4. Update this journal and our report.
